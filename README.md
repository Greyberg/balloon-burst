# Balloon Burst

## How to play

Run the game by executing the command 
`sbt "runMain BalloonBurst"` 
in the root directory

Follow the instructions

Enjoy!

## How to run the tests

ValidationHelperSpec is worth running with
`sbt "testOnly *.ValidationHelperSpec"`
from the root directory

The rest don't work.
I ran out of time but there is an indication of intent in the BalloonBurstSpec
